    "# The Orszag-Tang vortex: Calculus and Fourier analysis (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to study the properties of turbulent flows using numerical calculus and Fourier analysis. Let us consider the Orszag-Tang vortex system, which describes a doubly periodic fluid configuration leading to 2D supersonic magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence. Although an analytical solution is not known, its simple and reproducible set of initial conditions has made it a widespread benchmark for the comparison of MHD numerical solvers.\n",

    "The computational domain is periodic box with dimensions: $[0,2\\pi]^D$ where $D$ is the number of spatial dimensions.\n",

    "## 1. (5 points) Numerical calculus:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Create a set of Python functions that reads in the simulation data, normalises the data fields to CGS units (using units.out), returns all the data arrays (except magnetic fields, which won't be used) and the mesh, and sequentially prints the following figures into a folder called **\"output_n\"** for all times:\n",

    "Add time-stamps in CGS units to the above maps (using information from vkt.out). Show sample maps at a fixed time (VTK file # 40) in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Create a set of Python functions that loops over all the simulation VTK files, computes the flow circulation, $\\Gamma = \\iint_S \\vec\\nabla\\times \\vec v \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{S}$, and returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a CSV file with 2 columns (time and flow circulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- a figure of the flow circulation versus time. Show the resulting figure in this notebook too.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. (5 points) Shock analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Create a set of Python functions that isolate candidate shocked cells based on the following methods and sequentially prints the following shock candidate maps into a folder called **\"output_s\"** for all times:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method 1:** Read the 2D velocity vector field. Compute the divergence of the velocity field and isolate the cells where there are convergent flows (i.e. where $\\vec\\nabla\\cdot \\vec v <\\alpha$ with $\\alpha\\lesssim 0$). Cells with convergent flows are candidate shocked cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method 2:** Read the 2D pressure field. Compute the gradient of the pressure and isolate the cells with large pressure gradients (i.e. where $\\frac{|\\vec\\nabla P|}{P}>\\beta\\max{\\left(\\frac{|\\vec\\nabla P|}{P}\\right)}$ with $\\beta \\lesssim 0.1$). Such cells are candidate shocked cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Make binary maps of the resulting candidate shock cells from both methods. Show sample maps at a fixed time (VTK file # 40) in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. (5 points) Fourier analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Create a set of Python functions that Fourier transforms the density of any VTK file in 2D, applies high-pass and low-pass filters, smooths the density map using a 2D Gaussian, and sequentially prints the following figures into a folder called **\"output_f\"** for all times:\n",

    "## 4. (5 points) Interpretation:\n",

    "- What information do the velocity divergence and velocity curl provide about the flow in section 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the flow circulation reach steady state in section 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you find the same shock candidates on the maps obtained by Methods 1 and 2 in section 2?\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What do the high-pass and low-pass filter maps show in section 3?\n",
