    "\n",
    "Supernovae type Ia (SN Ia) are very energetic astronomical explosions, which have a very similar intrinsic known brightness (i.e. they have a very similar absolute magnitude $M$), so they can be used as cosmological \"standard candles\" to measure the luminosity distance, $d$, as a function of redshift, $z$:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $c$ is the speed of light and $H_0$ is the Hubble constant. Since they have similar absolute magnitudes $M$, we can estimate distances by comparing how bright or faint they appear on the sky as indicated by the measured apparent magnitude, $m$, which does differ:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher $m$ values imply objects are fainter; lower $m$ values imply objects are brighter. Same for $M$. Unfortunately, selection effects associated with instrumental limitations can bias our measurements. For example, far-away SN Ia can be so faint that they may not be detectable, so the sample will be biased towards brighter objects. In the equation above $\\rm Mpc$ stands for Mega parsecs, which are distance units used in cosmology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, to understand selection bias, we want to simulate this effect using a Monte Carlo simulation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this problem is to determine the bias as a function of redshift for a sample of objects (SN Ia) via a Monte Carlo calculation. To set up your simulation, assume that:\n",

    "(a) Write a python function to generate $N$ Gaussian random variables with mean $\\langle M\\rangle=-19.5\\,\\rm mag$ and different standard deviations ($\\sigma_M=0.1$, $0.3$, and $0.6\\,\\rm mag$).\n",

    "(b) Make $3$ plots of $M$ versus $N$, where $N$ is the number of generated objects, one for each $\\sigma_M$.\n",
