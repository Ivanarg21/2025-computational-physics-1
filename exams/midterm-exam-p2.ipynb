    "## 5. I/O and regression: Larmor precession (5 points) \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem consists of analysing the relationship between magnetic field strength and Larmor precession frequency, a fundamental principle in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). To this end, a simulated dataset was generated, mimicking experimental measurements, and stored in a CSV file. This dataset contains pairs of values: **magnetic field strength (in Tesla)** and the corresponding observed **Larmor frequency (in Hertz)**. The goal is to investigate the relationship predicted by the **Larmor equation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data:\n",
    "https://github.com/wbandabarragan/physics-teaching-data/blob/main/1D-data/larmor_precession_data.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Create a **pandas-based python I/O function** that opens the above data file and returns $2$ arrays, one for the magnetic field strength and one for the Larmor frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Call your I/O function and make **a high-quality labeled plot** of Larmor frequency (in the Y axis) versus magnetic field strength (in the X axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Write down and use a physical model (motivated by quantum mechanics) to carry out a regression and constrain any free parameters in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Report the results from your regression, i.e. the best-fit value for the free parameter/s with respective uncertainty/ies.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Make a plot showing the empirical data and the best-fit model obtained from your regression.  Based on your analysis, can you infer the particle assumed for the simulated data?\n",

    "This problem consists of analysing the reduction of the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) after treatment with Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. The images provided below were obtained from a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), before and after 5 hours of treatment with ZnO. One pixel of  the image has an area of $0.02^2\\mu m^2$.\n",

    "- Make a 2-panel figure showing the before and after SEM images.\n",
    "- Make a 2-panel figure showing the before and after pixel histograms of the SEM images.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Create a python function that isolates the area covered by the E. coli bacteria from the background. Your function should read in an image channel array and return a cleaned binary image array with zeroes in the background and ones in the E. coli area.\n",

    "- The total area in pixels and physical units covered by the E. coli bateria before and after treatment.\n",
    "- The ratio between such areas, how effective is the antibacterial treatment with ZnO nanoparticles?\n",
